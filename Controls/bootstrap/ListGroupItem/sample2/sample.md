## Sample 2: ListGroupItem - Item Types, Bindings & Other Properties

Similarly to Bootstrap each `ListGroupItem` can have different type. `ItemType` property specify what type of item will be generated.
Expected values are `Link` which generates "a" element, `Button` which generates "button" element. Default generated element is "li". 
 
Additionally the `ListGroupItem` control has the `IsDisabled` and `IsSelected` properties.

You can also use [GlyphIcon](/docs/controls/bootstrap/GlyphIcon/{branch}) or any other kind of HTML content inside the control.
