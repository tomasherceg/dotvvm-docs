## Sample 1: Basic Usage

Each menu item in the `ResponsiveNavigation` control is represented by the [NavigationItem](/docs/controls/bootstrap/NavigationItem/{branch}) control. 

The `HeaderText` property specifies the text that will be placed in the logo section of the navbar. 
If the `HeaderLinkUrl` property is set, the header will be rendered as a hyperlink for that URL.
