## Sample 1: Simple Collapsible Panel

The Collapsible panel has the same API as [Card](/docs/controls/bootstrap4/Card/{branch}). The difference is that only Header is visible when Collapsible panel is collapsed.

Collapsible panel can be collapsed/expanded by clicking on the header or using the `IsCollapsed` property.
