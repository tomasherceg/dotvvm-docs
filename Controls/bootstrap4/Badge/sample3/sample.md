## Sample 3: Badge as Link or Button

The `Badge` control can work as a button or a link.

* You may set `NavigateUrl` to make the badge to link to a specific URL.
* The `Click` event can be used to invoke a command in the viewmodel.
* You may also use `RouteName`, `Param-*`, `Query-*` and `UrlSuffix` properties to build a link from a route table. See [RouteLink](/docs/controls/builtin/RouteLink/{branch}) for details.
