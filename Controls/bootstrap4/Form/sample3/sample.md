## Sample 3: Horizontal Form Label Sizing

If the form is in the `Horizontal` mode, the labels are placed next to the form fields. 

In this case, you have to specify how wide the labels should be (how many columns they will occupy). You can use the `LabelSize` to provide a default size for all screens, and use `LabelSizeSM`, `LabelSizeMD`, `LabelSizeLG` and `LabelSizeXL` properties to override the label width for a particular screen size.

If you have customized Bootstrap grid system to have different number of columns, use the `NumberOfColumns` property on the [Container](/docs/controls/bootstrap/Container/{branch}) control.
