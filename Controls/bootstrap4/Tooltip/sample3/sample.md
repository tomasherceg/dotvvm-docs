## Sample 3: Tooltip Animation, Delay and Container

The `Tooltip` control uses CSS fade transition by default. It is possible to disable it using the `EnableAnimation` property.

The `Delay` property is used to delay showing and hiding of the popover (value represents number of seconds).

The `Container` property specifies the selector for an element in which the tooltip is created. It allows to position the popover in the flow of the document 
near the triggering element which will prevent the tooltip from floating away from the triggering element during a window resize.
