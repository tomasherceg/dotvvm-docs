## Sample 1: Basic Toast

The header content of `Toast` can be set be one of two ways: using the `HeaderText` property or using `HeaderTemplate`.  

The main content can be set using `Text` or `ContentTemplate`.  

It's not required to provide both header and content, but at least one is needed.

Showing and hidding the toast can be using the `IsDisplayed` property.
