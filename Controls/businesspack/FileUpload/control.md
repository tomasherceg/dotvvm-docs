Allows the user to upload one or multiple files asynchronously.

### Upload Configuration

The upload works on the background and starts immediately when the user selects the files. To make file uploading work, 
you have to specify where the temporary files will be uploaded.

The recommended strategy is to store the uploaded files in your application directory or in the temp directory (if your app have the appropriate permissions).
To define this, you have to register the `UploadedFileStorage` in the `IDotvvmServiceConfigurator`.

```CSHARP
public void ConfigureServices(IDotvvmServiceCollection options)
{
    options.AddUploadedFileStorage("App_Data/Temp");
}
```

### Using the Control

Then, you need to bind the `FileUpload` control to an `UploadData` object. It holds references to the files 
the user has selected and uploaded.

The `UploadData` object also has a useful property `IsBusy` which indicates whether the file upload is still in progress. You can use it e.g. on the button's `Enabled` property to disallow the user to continue until the upload is finished.

### Retrieving the Stored Files

The `UploadData` object contains only unique IDs of uploaded files. To get the file contents, you have to retrieve it using the `IUploadedFileStorage` service.

```CSHARP
public class UploadViewModel 
{
  private readonly IUploadedFileStorage storage;

  public UploadViewModel(IUploadedFileStorage storage)
  {
    this.storage = storage;
  }

  public void ProcessFiles()
  {
    foreach (var file in UploadData.Files)
    {
      if (file.Allowed)
      {
        // get the stream of the uploaded file and do whatever you need to do
        var stream = storage.GetFile(file.FileId);

        // OR you can just move the file from the temporary storage somewhere else
        var targetPath = Path.Combine(uploadPath, file.FileId + ".bin");
        storage.SaveAs(file.FileId, targetPath);
        
        // it is a good idea to delete the file from the temporary storage 
        // it is not required, the file would be deleted automatically after the timeout set in the DotvvmStartup.cs
        storage.DeleteFile(file.FileId);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The control can check whether the file extension matches any extension specified in the `AllowedFileTypes` definition, and verify that the file size does not exceed the `MaxFileSize`. 

You can use the `FileTypeAllowed` and `MaxSizeExceeded` properties of the file in the `UploadData` object to find out why the file was not allowed.

But please note that these value come from client-side and can't be trusted in security critical scenarios - make sure you verify the integrity of the files yourself.
