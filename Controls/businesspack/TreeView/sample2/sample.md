## Sample 2: Tree Item CheckBoxes

Using the `CheckBoxMode` property, you can display the checkboxes. The property has the following values:

* `Hidden` means that no checkboxes are displayed.
* `VisibleOnLeafs` means that the checkboxes are displayed for the items which don't have any children.
* `Visible` means tha the checkboxes are displayed for all items in the tree.

By default, the control checks also the descendant items when an item is checked. The `AutoCheckChildren` property can be used to disable this feature.
