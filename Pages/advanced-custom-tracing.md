# Custom Tracing of DotVVM Events

This guide describes how to achieve something similar to what the [MiniProfiler widget](./advanced-miniprofiler.md) does for any tracing technology you like. For the sake of example, we'll setup a very simple tracer that just prints the events to the standard output.


## `IRequestTracer` interface

You can implement a `IRequestTracer` interface and register the instance in the `ServiceCollection` and DotVVM will automatically call the methods on it.

### `TraceEvent`

The main method of the tracer is `TraceEvent` method. It receives name of the event as a string. We use string just to allow anyone to extend the set of events, but DotVVM itself will call you with following events.

* `BeginRequest` - when DotVVM gets the request from Asp.Net Core or OWIN. It's called before a matching route is selected, so the `context.Route` is going to be `null`.
* `ViewInitialized` - when the initial control tree is created, but before DotVVM initializes the view model
* `ViewModelCreated` - when the view model is creates, before it is deserialized and before `Init` is called
* `InitCompleted` - after `Init` is called on view model and all controls
* `ViewModelDeserialized` - after the view model is deserialized (only called for post backs)
* `LoadCompleted` - after `Load` is called on view model and all controls
* `CommandExecuted` - after the command is executed (only called for post backs)
* `PreRenderCompleted` - after `PreRender` is called on view model and all controls
* `ViewModelSerialized` - after the view model is serialized to JSON
* `OutputRendered` - when output HTML or JSON is written to the response body
* `StaticCommandExecuted` - after static command method is executed

### `EndRequest`

The `EndRequest(IDotvvmRequestContext context)` is called in case the request is handled successfully. The other overload `EndRequest(IDotvvmRequestContext context, Exception exception)` is used, in case an exception occurs.

All these method return a `Task`, so you can do any async operation. However, we encourage you to avoid long running operations since the tracing is called quite a bit of times during the request. If you want to monitor timing between the events of a DotVVM application, slow tracing may ruin your measurements.

## Sample tracer

With this knowledge, we can create a sample tracer, that will just write the timings to standard output. We'll start a `Stopwatch` when we get the `BeginRequest` event and then just print the elapsed time.

In our sample, we don't use async IO as writing using `Console.WriteLine` is more convenient.

```csharp
public class SampleRequestTracer : IRequestTracer
{
    Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();
    public Task TraceEvent(string eventName, IDotvvmRequestContext context)
    {
        if (eventName == "BeginRequest")
            sw.Start();
        Console.WriteLine($"Trace {sw.Elapsed}: {eventName}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task EndRequest(IDotvvmRequestContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Trace {sw.Elapsed}: End of request");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task EndRequest(IDotvvmRequestContext context, Exception exception)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Trace {sw.Elapsed}: Error occured ({exception})");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

Also note that only requests to the page itself are traced. Requests for resources are not included in DotVVM tracing.
