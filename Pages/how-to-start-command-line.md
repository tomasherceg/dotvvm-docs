# Create a new project (Command Line)

If you don't have Visual Studio, you can create a new DotVVM project from the command line using .NET Core templates.

## Install the template

First, you need to install the `dotnet new` template for DotVVM from NuGet. To do this, run the following command in the console:

```
dotnet new -i DotVVM.Templates::*
```

Please note that this command can take few minutes to execute.

## Run the template

When the template is installed, you can run it in an empty directory. The tooling will create a project there:

```
mkdir ProjectName
cd ProjectName
dotnet new dotvvm
```

## DotVVM Command Line syntax

The project generated by the template contains a reference to `DotVVM.CommandLine` package. You can invoke it by calling `dotnet dotvvm ...`. 

You can use this tool to create DotVVM pages, master pages and markup controls - see [DotVVM Command Line](/docs/tutorials/advanced-dotvvm-command-line/{branch}) chapter for more details.
